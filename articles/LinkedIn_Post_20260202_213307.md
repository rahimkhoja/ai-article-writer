# LinkedIn Post_20260202_213307

I gave an autonomous AI agent root access to my digital life for 48 hours. It was equal parts terrifying, expensive, and absolutely brilliant.

We need to talk about OpenClaw.

If you haven’t heard of it yet (formerly Claudebot/Moltbot), OpenClaw is an open-source autonomous agent that runs locally on your machine. Unlike ChatGPT, which lives in a browser tab and "chats," OpenClaw connects to your file system, calendar, email, and terminal. It has "hands and feet."

I decided to run a technical deep-dive, and here is the candid reality of moving from "AI chatbots" to "AI agents."

**The Setup: A Test of Patience 🛠️**
Do not let the "quick start" guides fool you. If you are running this locally to get the full benefit, prepare for frustration. The documentation is partial at best. I spent hours wrestling with Node.js versions, Docker containers, and API gateway errors. It is not plug-and-play yet; it is very much a "read the GitHub issues" experience.

**The Cost: A Warning 💸**
This was the biggest shock. Because OpenClaw is "autonomous," it loops. It thinks, it corrects itself, it tries again.
In just two days, I burned through **$100+ in API credits** before I even scratched the surface. If you aren't monitoring your token usage, a loop of "checking calendar -> error -> retrying" can drain your wallet overnight. $20–$50/day felt typical for heavy testing.

**The Experience: Why It’s Worth It 🚀**
Despite the setup pain and cost, when it clicked, it felt like magic.
I interacted with it almost exclusively through **Telegram**, which changes the dynamic entirely. It felt like texting a hyper-competent executive assistant.
*   I asked it to find a specific stock trend; it browsed the web, scraped the data, and built a CSV file on my desktop.
*   It managed my calendar and drafted email replies based on my tone.
*   It noticed a bug in a script, opened the file, fixed it, and committed the code.

**A Surprising Technical Observation 🤖**
While the project is named after Claude, in my specific setup, **Google’s models actually performed better than Anthropic’s.** I found the Gemini models to be faster at context switching and less prone to "laziness" when executing complex file system commands.

**The Verdict**
OpenClaw represents a massive shift. We are moving from "chatbots" that suggest text to "agents" that execute labor.

But proceed with caution:
1.  **Security:** You are giving an LLM broad permissions. Sandbox this. Do not run it on your primary work machine with sensitive client data.
2.  **Resources:** It requires oversight. It is not "set and forget" yet.

If you are technical and curious, it is absolutely worth the weekend project. Just keep an eye on your API bill.
